BrokeredPointOfService
======================
BrokeredPointOfService requires POS for .NET 1.14.  As long as you have the POS for .NET 1.14 assemblies 
installed on your machine, the BrokeredPointOfService solution should build as-is in your cloned repository. 

The BrokeredPointOfService library requires a system level environment variable named BrokeredPointOfService.  
For development, this should point to the output directory of BrokeredPointOfServiceProxyStub project.
